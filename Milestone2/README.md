# Proposal structure
For the second milestone we have to do 8 quality requirements. We agree that 5 will be run-time and 3 design time. To make our project structure clear I propose following structure:
    1. Run-time folder for run-time requirements
        - {Quality}{SourceOfStimulus}->{Artifact} subfolders (e.g. Availibility_NotificationWorker->ExamDatabase)
    3. Design-time folder for design-time requirements
