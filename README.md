## Zadání milesotne 1
"Documentation of your architecture in the repository:
- title and a short description of your system
- N different features, where N is the number of members of the team, for each feature:
 -- title, user story
 -- user story breakdown into user-system interaction
 -- responsibilities based on the breakdown
- C4 model of the architecture with the following diagrams:
--- one L1 diagram, one L2 diagram (can be split into more if necessary)
--- one L3 diagram for each container from L2
--- one dynamic diagram for each feature (i.e. N dynamic diagrams)
--- two deployment diagrams (one is development or testing, one is production)
- Assignment of the responsibilities to containers/components in the C4 architecture documentation

Presentation of your architecture:
- start with the name of your project and the names of the team members
- present an overview of the features (2mins)
--- show who worked on what features (no need to explain, just show it on the slides with the features)
- present an overview of the responsibilities based on the features (2mins)
--- present them grouped logically based on the groupings from the practicals
- present your architecture in the C4 model
--- start with L1, then continue to L2, explain all containers and relationships between them (4mins)
----- show who worked on what at the L2 level (no neet to explain, just show it on the slides)
--- select one or two most interesting containers from L2 and explain their components at L3 (2mins)
--- show one dynamic diagram and explain it shortly, show who worked on it (1mins)
--- show one deployment diagram and explain it shortly, show who worked on it (2mins)"

## Zadání milestone 2
"Documentation of the quality requirements and architectural changes in your repository:
Describe 2*n quality requirement scenarios for at least n quality dimensions.
- n = number of team members
- >= n/2 quality requirement scenarios in design-time attributes (modifiability, testability, interoperability)
- <= 3*n/2 quality requirement scenarios in run-time attributes (performance, availability, scalability, security)

For each scenario, decide if the architecture needs to be updated.
- Use the architectural styles and tactics from the lecture.
- If yes, update the C4 model and explain
- If not, explain why the current architecture can fulfill the scenario

Presentation:
- start with the name of your previous project and the new project + the names of the team members
- present n quality requirement scenarios, one per team member, and for each explain:
-- what quality attribute it is
-- who worked on it (only have it on the slide, do not read it)
-- show and explain the scenario
-- explain its impact on the architecture (Is there an impact? If no, why? If yes, show the updated part of the architecture and explain)"
